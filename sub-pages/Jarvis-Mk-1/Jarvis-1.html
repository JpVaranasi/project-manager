                    Jarvis is a project that is highly complicated which is inspired from Jarvis from the Marvel's Iron Man films. At the time for writing there are 4 versions with the last one in developement. This is the first of the four versions.

                    <br>
                    Built using python one my first sophisticated projects. Had two modules , main and the advanced. With the main version being a simple cli with speech recognition.

                    <br>
                    The extra features in advanced version include:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1.Introduction of PyAutoGui library.<br>
                    2.Control of mouse, keyboard and volume functions. <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After this point I was convinced working with a CLI is much less efficient in this case and wanted to explore further libraries and skills. This paved the way to Mk2.
