                    After experimenting with the fully functioning Mk1 of Jarvis, I now had an idea of what I wanted instead of starting blindly and slowly building through. Mk2 had a GUI instead of a CLI to create a much more immersive and realistic experience.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This version definetly took a long more time than Mk1 and also helped me learn quite a bit about programming and a lot about how much I dont know in the world of computer science. I also shifted this down to 1 version.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The main features of this version include (features from Mk1 are carried forward.):<br><br>
                    1.Loading screen.<br>
                    2.GUI<br>
                    3.Video players for GUI <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This version was more focused on GUI than features, thats why Mk3 was created to include better GUI as well as more new features.
