                    Losing key fobs and having to skip lunch is always a headache but some have often come up with creative solutions such as attaching the fobs to their keys or having a lanyard on their person. But this does not alter the core problem , misplacement. I study in an Apple distinguished school , which translates to every student having to have an iPad throughout the school day. 
                    Using that to my advantage , I hope to build a foundation to a program that digitizes key fobs themselves. With every student having to have an iPad, key fobs may as well be considered the alternative and the iPads the new normal. In the future this program could also lead to the food orders themselves being digitized and removing the need to stand in lunch time queues for long times.
